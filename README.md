"""Practicals
 For practical Labs for Machine Learning, students may use softwares like MATLAB/ Octave/
 Python/ R. Utilize publically available datasets from online repositories like https://data.gov.in/
 and https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php
 For evaluation of the regression/classification models, perform experiments as follows:
 ● Splitdatasets into training and test sets and evaluate the decision models
 ● Performk-cross-validation on datasets for evaluation
 Report the efficacy of the machine learning models as follows:
 ● MSEandR2scoreforregression models
 ● Accuracy, TP, TN, FP, TN, error, Recall, Specificity, F1-score, AUC for
 classification models
 For relevant datasets make prediction models for the following:
 1.Naïve Bayes Classifier
Simple Linear Regression
 Multiple linear regression
 Polynomial Regression
 Lasso and Ridge Regression
 Logistic regression
 Artificial Neural Network
 K-NN classifier
 Decision tree classification
 SVMclassification
 K-means clustering
 Hierarchical clusterin"""
