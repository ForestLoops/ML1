 For practical Labs for Machine Learning, students may use softwares like MATLAB/ Octave/
 Python/ R. Utilize publically available datasets from online repositories like https://data.gov.in/
 and https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

 For evaluation of the regression/classification models, perform experiments as follows:
       ● Splitdatasets into training and test sets and evaluate the decision models
       ● Performk-cross-validation on datasets for evaluation
 Report the efficacy of the machine learning models as follows:
       ● MSEandR2scoreforregression models
       ● Accuracy, TP, TN, FP, TN, error, Recall, Specificity, F1-score, AUC for classification 
         models
 For relevant datasets make prediction models for the following:
     1.Naïve Bayes Classifier
     2. Simple Linear Regression
     3. Multiple linear regression
     4. Polynomial Regression
     5. Lasso and Ridge Regression
     6. Logistic regression
     7. Artificial Neural Network
     8. K-NN classifier
     9. Decision tree classification
    10. SVMclassification
    11. K-means clustering
    12. Hierarchical clusterin```
